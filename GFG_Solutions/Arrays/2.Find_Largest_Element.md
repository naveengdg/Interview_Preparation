# Problem: Largest Element in Array

### Problem Statement
Given an array `arr[]`, the task is to find the largest element and return it.

- **Input**: An array of integers.
- **Output**: A single integer, representing the largest element in the array.

**Examples**:
- **Input**: `[1, 8, 7, 56, 90]`  
  **Output**: `90`  
  **Explanation**: The largest element in the given array is `90`.

- **Input**: `[5, 5, 5, 5]`  
  **Output**: `5`  
  **Explanation**: All elements are the same, so the largest element is `5`.

- **Input**: `[10]`  
  **Output**: `10`  
  **Explanation**: There is only one element, which is the largest.

### Approach
1. Initialize a variable `larger` to the first element of the array, which will hold the largest value found so far.
2. Traverse each element in the array:
   - If the current element is greater than `larger`, update `larger` to the current element.
3. After traversing the array, `larger` will hold the largest element.
4. Return `larger` as the result.

### Solution Code
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def largest(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize the largest element
        larger = arr[0]
        
        # Traverse through the array to find the largest element
        for num in arr:
            if num > larger:
                larger = num
                
        return larger
```

### Complexity Analysis
1. **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array (we traverse the array once).
2. **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
